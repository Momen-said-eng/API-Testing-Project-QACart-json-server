# API-Testing-Project-QACart-json-server
As part of my API testing practice, I developed and tested a mock RESTful API using JSON Server. I created various endpoints and used Postman to test different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), focusing on validating responses, handling edge cases, and simulating real-world scenarios.
After thorough manual testing, I utilized Newman to automate the API test execution and integrated HTML Extra Reporter to generate clear, visually structured HTML reports for the test results.
